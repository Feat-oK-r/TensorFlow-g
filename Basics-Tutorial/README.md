## Basics Tutorial

This short tutorial will show you how to get started with distributed TensorFlow.  The aim is to get you familiar with basic distributed TF concepts that are reoccuring, such as servers, and local vs global variable updates.  You should work throught the content in the following order 

1. [`Server.ipynb`](Servers.ipynb)
2. [`Parameter-Server.ipynb'](Parameter-Server.ipynb)
3. [`Local-then-Global-Variables.ipynb`](Local-then-Global_Variables.ipynb)
4. [`Multiple-Workers`](Multiple-Workers/).

The Multiple-Workers exercise requires three notebooks, and should be started from the Worker1 notebook.
